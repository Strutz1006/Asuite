# Proposed Feature Enhancements for Aesyros Flow

### 1. Visual Process Mapping and Design

*   **BPMN 2.0 Compliant Modeler**: Implement a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 compliant visual modeler. This will allow users to create, edit, and share standardized process diagrams.
*   **Collaborative Design**: Enable real-time collaboration on process diagrams, allowing multiple users to work on the same process model simultaneously.

### 2. Automated Process Discovery and Mining

*   **Log File Analysis**: Develop a tool that can analyze log files from various systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) to automatically discover and visualize existing business processes.
*   **Variant Analysis**: Identify and compare different variations of the same process to identify inefficiencies and best practices.

### 3. Intelligent Process Orchestration and Automation

*   **Low-Code/No-Code Automation**: Provide a simple interface for users to automate repetitive tasks within their processes without writing any code.
*   **Integration with RPA Tools**: Integrate with popular Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools to enable end-to-end process automation.

### 4. Proactive Compliance and Risk Management

*   **Compliance Rule Engine**: Create a rule engine where users can define compliance rules and automatically check their process models for violations.
*   **AI-Powered Risk Prediction**: Use AI to analyze process data and predict potential risks, such as bottlenecks, compliance breaches, or fraudulent activities.
