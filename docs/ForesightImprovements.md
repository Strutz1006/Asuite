# Proposed Feature Enhancements for Aesyros Foresight

### 1. Intuitive Scenario Building and Visualization

*   **Natural Language Scenario Creation**: Allow users to describe a scenario in plain English, and have the AI translate it into a formal model.
*   **Multi-Layered Scenarios**: Enable users to create complex, multi-layered scenarios that include a wide range of variables and assumptions.
*   **Visual Scenario Comparison**: Develop a tool that allows users to visually compare the potential outcomes of different scenarios side-by-side.

### 2. Advanced Simulation and Analysis

*   **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Implement Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of different outcomes in a complex system or process.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis**: Provide tools for conducting sensitivity analysis to identify the key drivers of a scenario's outcome.
*   **AI-Powered Insights**: Use AI to analyze the results of simulations and identify non-obvious insights and relationships between variables.

### 3. Collaborative Decision-Making

*   **Scenario Sharing and Collaboration**: Allow users to share scenarios with colleagues and collaborate on their development and analysis.
*   **Decision-Making Workflow**: Create a workflow that guides users through the process of using scenario analysis to make decisions.
*   **Integration with Aesyros Align**: Integrate with Aesyros Align to link scenarios to strategic goals and objectives.

### 4. Real-time Data Integration and Monitoring

*   **Real-time Data Feeds**: Integrate with internal and external data sources to feed real-time data into the scenario models.
*   **Automated Scenario Updates**: Automatically update scenarios based on changes in the real-time data feeds.
*   **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts to notify users when key metrics or assumptions in a scenario change significantly.
