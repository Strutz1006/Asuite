# Proposed Feature Enhancements for Aesyros Catalyst

### 1. Guided Change Journeys

*   **Journey Templates**: Create pre-built templates for common change initiatives (e.g., technology adoption, process improvement, cultural transformation). These templates would include stages, milestones, and suggested actions.
*   **Visual Journey Mapping**: A drag-and-drop interface to create and customize change journeys. This would allow users to visualize the entire change process and identify potential roadblocks.

### 2. Stakeholder Engagement and Management

*   **Stakeholder Analysis Tools**: Implement tools to map stakeholders based on their influence and interest. This would help change managers tailor their communication and engagement strategies.
*   **Communication Hub**: A centralized place to manage all communications related to the change initiative. This could include announcements, newsletters, and targeted messages to specific stakeholder groups.

### 3. Actionable Insights and Recommendations

*   **Readiness Assessments**: Create surveys and assessments to gauge the organization's readiness for change. The results would provide insights into potential areas of resistance and inform the change management plan.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations**: An AI engine that analyzes data from readiness assessments, stakeholder feedback, and progress on change activities to provide proactive recommendations to the change team.

### 4. Integration with Aesyros Pulse

*   **Real-time Feedback Loops**: Integrate with Aesyros Pulse to gather real-time feedback from employees on the change initiative. This would allow for quick adjustments to the change plan based on the sentiment on the ground.
*   **Impact Measurement**: Use data from Pulse to measure the impact of the change initiative on key business metrics. This would help demonstrate the value of the change and secure buy-in for future initiatives.
