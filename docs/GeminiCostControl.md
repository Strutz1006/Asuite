### Strategies for Controlling Gemini API Costs

A multi-layered approach is most effective, combining architectural patterns, API best practices, and diligent monitoring.

#### 1. Architectural & Service-Level Controls (In your new `gemini-service`)

This is your first and most powerful line of defense.

*   **Implement Caching:** This is the single most important strategy. Many user requests will be similar or identical. Caching the responses from the Gemini API prevents redundant calls.
    *   **How:** Use an in-memory cache (like `node-cache`) for simplicity or, even better, a shared Redis cache. Your `docker-compose.yml` already includes a Redis service, which is perfect for this.
    *   **Example:** Before making a call to Gemini for a goal validation, your `gemini-service` would first check if a response for that exact goal text already exists in Redis. If so, it returns the cached response instantly without hitting the Gemini API.
    *   **Cache Key:** The cache key should be a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the prompt sent to Gemini.
    *   **TTL (Time-To-Live):** Set a reasonable expiration time for your cache entries (e.g., 24 hours) so the content can be periodically refreshed if needed.

*   **Per-User Rate Limiting:** The gateway has a global rate limiter, but you should also implement a finer-grained limit within the `gemini-service`.
    *   **How:** Assign an identifier to each user making a request. Before processing a request, check how many requests that user has made in the last hour or day. If they exceed a threshold (e.g., 100 AI requests per day), you can temporarily block them.
    *   **Why:** This prevents a single user (or a compromised user account) from causing a massive spike in your bill.

*   **Request Queuing:** Instead of sending a burst of simultaneous requests to the Gemini API, use a queue to process them with a fixed concurrency.
    *   **How:** Use a library like `p-queue` in your Node.js `gemini-service`. You can configure it to process, for example, a maximum of 5 requests to the Gemini API at any given time.
    *   **Why:** This smooths out traffic spikes and gives you more predictable control over your API usage.

#### 2. Efficient API Usage & Prompt Engineering

How you call the API is just as important as when you call it.

*   **Choose the Right Model:** Not all tasks require the most powerful (and expensive) Gemini model. For simpler tasks like basic text classification or extraction, a smaller, cheaper model may be sufficient. Regularly check the Google AI pricing page to understand the cost differences.

*   **Optimize Token Count:** You are billed based on the number of input and output tokens.
    *   **Input Prompts:** Make your prompts as concise as possible while still being effective. Avoid sending unnecessary text or context.
    *   **Output Limits:** Use the `maxOutputTokens` parameter in your API calls. This puts a hard cap on the length of the response Gemini will generate, which directly controls the cost of that call. For example, when asking for KPI suggestions, you can limit the response to 1000 tokens to prevent unexpectedly long (and expensive) answers.

#### 3. Monitoring, Budgeting, and Alerting

You cannot control what you cannot see.

*   **Set Google Cloud Budgets and Alerts:** This is non-negotiable.
    *   **How:** In your Google Cloud Platform console, navigate to the Billing section.
    *   **Budgets:** Create a budget for your project (e.g., $50/month).
    *   **Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you by email when your spending reaches certain percentages of your budget (e.g., 50%, 90%, and 100%). This is your safety net to prevent surprise bills.

*   **Implement Detailed Logging:** In your `gemini-service`, log every request made to the Gemini API.
    *   **What to Log:**
        *   Timestamp
        *   User ID (if available)
        *   The specific feature used (e.g., `validate-goal`)
        *   The input prompt (or a hash of it)
        *   The token count for the request and response (this is often included in the API response)
        *   The model used
    *   **Why:** This data is invaluable for identifying which features are most expensive and where you should focus your optimization efforts.

#### 4. User-Facing Strategies

Control costs by managing how and when users can trigger AI features.

*   **Use Explicit User Actions:** Don't trigger expensive API calls automatically. Require the user to click a button like "Analyze Goal" or "Suggest KPIs." Avoid triggering calls on every keystroke.
*   **Debounce Inputs:** For any feature that might be triggered by typing, use a "debounce" function to ensure the API is only called after the user has stopped typing for a moment.
*   **Consider Feature Tiers:** In the long term, you could offer basic features for free and reserve the more advanced (and expensive) AI features for users on a paid subscription plan. This aligns your costs with your revenue.
