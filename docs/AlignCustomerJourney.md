# Aesyros Align: Customer Journey

This document outlines the typical customer journey for a new organization adopting the Aesyros Align platform. It follows a logical progression from initial setup to strategic execution, reflecting the core principles of the OKR methodology.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Setup

The first phase is about establishing the organizational context. This is typically performed by an administrator or a leadership team.

**1. Initial Login and Welcome:**
- The user signs in for the first time.
- A welcome modal or a setup wizard appears, guiding them through the initial steps.

**2. Organization Setup:**
- **Organization Name:** The user is prompted to enter the name of their organization.
- **Vision Statement:** A dedicated section to input the company's long-term vision. This serves as the "North Star" for all subsequent goals.
- **Mission Statement:** The user defines the company's mission â€“ what the organization does, who it serves, and why.
- **Core Values:** A space to list the company's core values, which will inform behavior and decision-making.

**3. Structuring the Organization:**
- **Departments:** The user creates the different departments within the organization (e.g., "Engineering," "Marketing," "Sales").
- **Teams:** Within each department, the user can define smaller teams (e.g., "Frontend Developers," "Content Marketing").
- **User Invitations:** The administrator invites other users to the platform, assigning them to their respective departments and teams, and setting their roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Contributor).

## Phase 2: Strategic Goal Setting (OKRs)

With the organizational structure in place, the focus shifts to defining the high-level strategic objectives.

**1. Setting Company-Wide Objectives:**
- The leadership team navigates to the "Objectives" section.
- They create a new **company-level objective** for the current quarter or year (e.g., "Achieve Product-Market Fit").
- For this objective, they define several **Key Results** that are specific, measurable, and time-bound (e.g., "Increase user retention by 15%," "Achieve an NPS score of 40," "Secure 10 new enterprise clients").

**2. Cascading Objectives to Departments:**
- Department heads, in collaboration with their teams, now create **department-level objectives** that align with the company-wide objectives.
- For example, the Marketing department might create an objective like "Increase Brand Awareness and Lead Generation."
- Their Key Results would be more specific to their function (e.g., "Generate 500 marketing qualified leads," "Increase website traffic by 20%").

**3. Team and Individual Goal Creation:**
- This process continues down to the team and individual level.
- A "Content Marketing" team might have an objective to "Become a Thought Leader in the Industry," with Key Results like "Publish 12 high-quality blog posts" and "Host 3 webinars."
- Individual contributors can then set their own goals that contribute to their team's objectives.

## Phase 3: Execution and Tracking

This phase is about the day-to-day work of making progress on the defined objectives.

**1. Regular Check-ins:**
- Users regularly update the progress of their Key Results. This can be done manually (e.g., updating a percentage) or, in future versions, automatically through integrations.
- The platform encourages a regular cadence of check-ins (e.g., weekly).

**2. Monitoring Progress:**
- The **Dashboard** provides a real-time overview of progress at all levels.
- Users can see at a glance which objectives are "On Track," "At Risk," or "Completed."
- The visual goal map allows everyone to see how their work contributes to the bigger picture.

**3. Collaboration and Communication:**
- Users can leave comments on objectives and key results to ask questions, provide updates, or offer support.
- This fosters transparency and helps to resolve roadblocks quickly.

## Phase 4: Review and Adaptation

At the end of a cycle (e.g., a quarter), the organization reviews its performance and adapts its strategy for the next cycle.

**1. Reporting and Analytics:**
- The "Reporting" section provides detailed insights into goal completion rates, performance by department, and overall progress towards the company's vision.
- This data is used to inform the next cycle of goal setting.

**2. Retrospectives:**
- Teams and departments hold retrospective meetings to discuss what went well, what didn't, and what can be improved.
- The insights from these meetings are used to refine the goal-setting process itself.

**3. Planning the Next Cycle:**
- Based on the results of the previous cycle and any changes in the business environment, the organization begins the process of setting new objectives for the next quarter or year.

This customer journey ensures that Aesyros Align is not just a tool for tracking goals, but a platform that drives strategic alignment, execution, and continuous improvement.
